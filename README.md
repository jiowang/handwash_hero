Upon detection of hands within the field of view of the Leap Motion Controller, the program will initiate and proceed as the user follows the steps correctly. 
In between the completion of each steps and when all the steps are completed, there will be a congratulatory message and visuals!

When hands are far apart, the progress of the step will pause until the user resumes with the corresponding handwashing step.
